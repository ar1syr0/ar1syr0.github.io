# Aristeidis Syrogiannis – “It Worked on My Machine”

Hello friends 🤖  
Just your friendly neighbourhood tech enthusiast, cosplaying as a Snr. Systems Analyst.

I record, experiment, build questionable side projects at 2AM, and occasionally indulge in some dangerously confident vibe coding.

Good vibes (beta version), humour enabled, self-sarcasm running in production. 

## Projects
- **[Har Analyzer](/projects/har_analyzer/)**
  JSON Reader – Because Raw JSON at 1AM is a Horror Movie.
